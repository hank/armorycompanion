    <string name="helpText">This app will broadcast signed transactions from an offline instance of armory. See the
        video here (placeholder) for a demonstration. There are other utilities available on [insert github link] that
        can be used with the offline instance.\n\nThe reason behind this app is to remove the necessity of using USB
        drives to move unsigned transactions to offline wallets and to move signed transactions back online. This way,
        one can scan the offline transaction with their offline wallet webcam, sign it, then scan the output with their
        phone to broadcast it on the bitcoin network.
